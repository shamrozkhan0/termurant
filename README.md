## Description
Termurant is a terminal-based restaurant ordering system written in Python.  
It allows users to view a menu and place orders, while providing a secure
admin mode protected by password authentication.

The admin can:
- Add new items to the menu
- Update existing menu items and prices

The program is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and focuses
on practicing core Python concepts.

## Motivation
I built this project to practice and apply multiple Python programming
concepts in a single, real-world–style application.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- CSV file processing
- Error Handling
- Input Validation
- Regular Expressions

## Files
- `restaurant.py` — Contains the core logic for the restaurant ordering system
- `admin.py` — Handles admin authentication and menu management
- `project.py` — The main entry point of the program
- `menu.csv` — Stores menu items and their prices
- `test_project.py` — Contains tests for the project

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File handling using CSV files
- Writing robust error-handling logic
- Validating user input effectively
